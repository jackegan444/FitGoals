# FitGoals

FitGoals is an Android fitness-tracking app written in Java using Android Studio. Users are able to log runs by inputting a run name, total time, and distance covered. FitGoals utilizes Android's Room persistence library to store logged runs in a local SQLite database which allows for seamless adding, deleting, and editing of data. Users can view all of their previously logged runs and make any changes/deletions necessary. I'm not actively working on FitGoals, but would eventually like to add a race time predictor as well as tracking for strength-training workouts.
